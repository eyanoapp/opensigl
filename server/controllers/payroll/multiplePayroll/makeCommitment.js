/**
 * @function config
 *
 * @description
 * This is an HTTP interface to schedule employees for payment in th payroll module.
 * It is exposed on the URL /multiple_payroll/:id/commitment.
 *
 * Practically, this function is just a switch that reads the enterprise settings
 * and determines which underlying commitment function to call. The work of actually
 * writing data to the database is done by either the commitments, groupedCommitment,
 * or commitmentByEmployee function(s). This is because OpenSIGL supports three different
 * kinds of commitment functions, which affects how the transactions are represented in
 * the Posting Journal.
 *
 *  1) @TODO(jniles): figure out what commitments() does.
 *  2) groupedComitments() groups all the employee information into as few transactions as possible.
 *     In practice, this means that one voucher with multiple lines for each employee for each transaction type,
 *     such as employee benefits, pension, tax withholdings, etc.
 *       Advantages:
 *          - There are fewer transactions to audit, and may be more familiar to those coming from a
 *          paper-based system.
 *          - Less data written to the posting_journal/general_ledger.
 *        Disadvantages:
 *          - Some detail/precision is lost in the bulk transactions.
 *          - More difficult to ascertain if a given employee received all the benefits they were owed.
 *  3) commitmentsByEmployee() writes unique transactions for each employee with a detailed description for better
 *     financial tracking as compared to group transactions.  This option produces the most volument and verbose
 *     transactions.
 *         Advantages:
 *           - It is comparatively easy to determine that each employee received their full benefits.
 *           - More information is included in the descriptive text, aiding future lookups.
 *         Disadvantages:
 *           - Many more transactions are written to posting_journal, whicn mean analyzing any given transaction may
 *           lose the context of the greater payroll period.
 *
 * The default option is the "commitments" function from "./commitment".
